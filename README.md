# 🚀 Enterprise AI Architecture in C++

A modern, scalable, and production-ready Enterprise Artificial Intelligence Architecture built entirely in C++ for high-performance environments.

This project demonstrates how to design and implement an enterprise-grade AI system using clean architecture principles, modular design patterns, GPU acceleration, CI/CD readiness, and cloud deployment capabilities.

## 📌 Project Vision

To provide a robust C++ AI backbone suitable for:

🏦 Financial AI systems

🏥 Healthcare intelligence platforms

🏭 Industrial automation

🌍 Edge AI & IoT deployments

## 🧠 High-performance inference engines

Built with enterprise standards in mind.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

The system follows a Clean Architecture + Modular Microservice Style:

## ⚙️ Build Instructions
1️⃣ Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/bundlab/enterprise-ai-cpp.git
cd enterprise-ai-cpp

2️⃣ Create Build Directory
mkdir build
cd build

3️⃣ Configure Project
cmake ..


If using CUDA:

cmake -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc ..

4️⃣ Build
make -j$(nproc)

5️⃣ Run
./enterprise_ai

## 🧪 Running Tests
ctest


or

./tests/runTests

## 🐳 Docker Deployment
docker build -t enterprise-ai .
docker run -p 8080:8080 enterprise-ai

## 🔥 GPU Acceleration (Optional)

This project supports NVIDIA CUDA acceleration.

Requirements:

- NVIDIA GPU
- CUDA Toolkit installed
- Proper CUDAToolkit_ROOT configured

Example:

- export CUDAToolkit_ROOT=/usr/local/cuda
- cmake ..

## 🔐 Enterprise-Grade Features

- Thread-safe AI pipeline
- Configurable inference engine
- Logging abstraction
- Structured error handling
- Horizontal scalability ready
- Container orchestration friendly

## 📊 Example Use Cases
- Industry	Application
- Finance	Fraud Detection
- Healthcare	Medical AI Inference
- Retail	Recommendation Engine
- IoT	Edge Device Intelligence
- Manufacturing	Predictive Maintenance

## 🧩 Extending the System

To add a new model:

- Create a new class in /models
- Implement the IModel interface
- Register inside ModelFactory
- Rebuild
- Clean and simple.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline
